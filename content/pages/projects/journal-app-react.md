This is a port of the vanilla JS of the same project into a react project. It makes use of react query for state management and demonstrates my skills with using library and implementing complex functionalities with react. The project is filled with a lot of complex, dynamic and re-usable components, complex state management, making use of the ContextAPI, useReducer for keeping local state in sync and react query for remote state correlation. Each components had its own distinct challenges with implementation like the `Overlay` component which kept track of each overlayed component stacked ontop of other components, the component positioning relative to the triggering element and much more.

It was pretty great working on this project, it showcases my skill in working on a certain level of complexity with react and also in porting projects into react logic.
